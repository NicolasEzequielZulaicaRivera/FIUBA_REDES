Transport Layer : Transmits messages between proceses\* ( multiplexes / demultiplexes )

> \* entities , nowadays there are devices without proceses

##### Connection : Data Flow

Needs at least 4 thing

- src ip (\* Network)
- src port
- dest ip (\* Network)
- dest port

> checksum

##### Transport Layer

- Best effort transport
  - inherited from the network
  - simplifies the design of the network
  - made internet grow, dominating the tech ( reliable network tech was slow & expensive )
- Provides:
  - communication multiplexing
  - minimal error verification
- Could provide
  - Reliability ( arrives . unchanged . in order )
  - Flow control ( throttle , with an eye on the data flow )
  - Congestion control ( throttle , with an eye on the network )
  - Security / Safety (Privacy / Authentication / Data Integrity / ect)

##### Principles of reliable transport

- Connected / Not Connected
- Ensure delivery
- Ensure order
- Ensure integrity
- Performance
- Flow control
- Share the channel equitably

###### Flow types

- Stop & Wait
- Pipeline
  - Go Back N
  - Selective Repeat

###### Mechanism Summary

- Checksum / CRC
- Timer
- Sequence Number
- ACK / NACK
- Sliding Window
