Network Layer - Control Plane

#### Control Plane

- routing / forwarding

##### distributed vs centralized

- **distributed**
  - routers talk among each other and set their tables
- **centralized**
  - a central entity (SDN) determines the routing tables for all routers
  - problem: scalability
  - examples
    - **CGR** : Contact Graph Routing -> Used for satellites

##### dynamic vs static

- **static**
  - used locally or in small networks / default route
- **dynamic**
  - constantly updates
  - most common

##### traffic dependent vs independent

- **traffic dependent**
  - cost of travel ( weight ) varies with traffic between nodes
  - weight's oscillate and thus paths change
- **traffic independent**

#### Internet's organization

##### Autonomous Systems

Network that is administered in a centralized manner,
the administrator is responsible for the network (and any attack originating from it)

##### ISPs

##### Hierarchy & Relations

#### Routing protocols
