#### TCP

- TCP unit of measurement: segment (data)
- Reliable communication
- Enumerated packets
  - The last byte number of the segment is the sequence number
  - ACK number is the next expected sequence number
- each segment (message) has its ow timeout
- RTT can only use ACKd packets ( we don't now how much time a package took without )
  - T(i) = RTT( i ) 路 a + T(i-1) 路 (1-a)
  - DT(i) = | RTT( i ) - T(i-1) | 路 b + DT(i-1) 路 (1-b)
  - RTO =~ T + 4 DT
    > Retransmission Timeout
- Sender window
  - RTT
  - Throughput
  - MSS (Max Segment Size) (?)
  - rwin (receiver window)
- Symmetrical Connection is a thing ( Both ends start connection simultaneously )
- Both can close connection independently
  - The other may continue to send messages ( and they will be ACKd )
- Window Size = min( rwin, cwin )
  > This was a confusing explanation
  > The book was clearer
  - rwin -> receiver window, part of TCP header
  - cwin -> congestion window
    - initial value = 1 mss
    - **slow start**
      - ssthres: slow start threshold
      - ssthres initial value = as high as possible = 65535
      - for each ACK received, cwin doubled -> cwin = cwnin + 1 mss (?)
      - if 3 repeated ACK are received -> cwin = ssthres = cwin / 2
    - congestion avoidance
      - cwin >= ssthres
      - if ACK -> cwin = cwnin + mss / cwin
    - back to 1mss if timeout
      - congestion control
