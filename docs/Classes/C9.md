#### Link Layer 1

##### Types

- Point to Point
- Multiple Access

##### Services

- Framing (data separation)
  > adds layer header
- Link Access (MAC)
  > broadcast sharing
- Reliable Transfer
  > slow and hardly implemented as transfer media is pretty reliable nowadays
  > most wireless devices do something to this end
- Error detection and correction

#####Â Physical Measures

- Potency & Attenuation
  > Signal strength is lost over distance
  > Also, reflection may cause shifted waves to cancel or attenuate the signal
- BER ( Bit Error Rate )
  > ErredBits / TotalTransmittedBits
  > Wireless BER = 10e-3 -> 10e-5 (now)
  > Optic Fiber BER = 10e-9 ( 1 erred bit in 100MB )
- Error detection and correction
  > As a rule of thumb, the number of bits that can be corrected is half of what can be detected
  > Adds very little overhead and increases reliability a lot (eg. wireless: +1% err , x10e-5 BER)
  - Parity Verification
    > Not really used, not good enough
    - uni-dimensional
    - bi-dimensional
  - CRC ( Cyclic Redundancy Check )
    > Link Layer err handling is CRC or better

##### Multiple Access Protocols

- Broadcasting Media ( Diffusion )
- Security Issues, everything is listened by everyone

  > Optic Fiber can be 'listened to' too ( shave it a little & it filters light )

- M / MA -> Multiplexing / Multiple Access

###### Channel Partitioning

deterministic but limits transmission rates

- TDM : Time Division Multiplexing
- FDM : Frequency Division Multiplexing
- CDM : Code Division Multiplexing

###### Random Access

- ALOHA
- Slotted ALOHA
- CSMA
  - CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection)
  - CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Avoidance )
  - CS: Don't speak if someone else is speaking
  - CD
    - Detects collisions
    - thought for cabled MA, where everyone hears everything
  - CA
    - In wireless connections all hosts might not hear each other (hidden agent)
    - Access point ( who does hear everyone ) acknowledges messages
    - There is a slot for acknowledgements
    - works well thanks to low latency

###### Taking-Turns

- (Centralized)
- Token Ring (Decentralized)
  - High Utilization ( almost 100% )
  - If a host disconnects the ring needs to be rebuilt
  - died because it was too expensive
  - Max Token Time, Host Number -> Thus Max wait time is known -> Good for Real Time
- Token Bus (Decentralized)
  - Builds on Token Ring using Ethernet's cheap technology
  - Its troublesome when the token bearer dies

##### Other notes

- Norms
  - IEEE 802.3 , IEEE 802.11 , ...
  - Depict link layer protocols ( WiFi, Ethernet, ... )
  - Rule todays communications
