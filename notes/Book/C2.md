Network applications are the raisons d’être of a computer network

#### 2.1 Principles of Network Applications

At the core of network application development is writing programs that run on different end systems and communicate with each other over the network

##### Network Application Architectures

From the application developer’s perspective, the network architecture is fixed and provides a specific set of **services** to applications

###### Client-Server Architecture

In a client-server architecture, there is an always-on host, called the **server**, which services requests from many other hosts, called **clients**

A single-server host is incapable of keeping up with all the requests from clients. For this reason, a **data center**, housing a large number of hosts, is often used to create a powerful virtual server

###### P2P Architecture

- there is minimal (or no) reliance on dedicated server
- the application exploits direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called **peers**
- One of the most compelling features of P2P architectures is their **self-scalability**
- However, P2P applications face challenges of security, performance, and reliability due to their highly decentralized structure

##### Processes Communicating

It is not actually programs but **processes** that communicate

Processes on two different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging **messages** across the computer network

A **network application** consists of pairs of processes that send messages to each other over a network

> In the context of a communication session between a pair of processes, the process that initiates the communication (that is, initially contacts the other process at the beginning of the session) is labeled as the **client**. The process that waits to be contacted to begin the session is the **server**

###### The Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network

A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a **socket**

A socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host

It is also referred to as the Application **Programming Interface (API)** between the application and the network

###### Addressing Processes

To identify the receiving process, two pieces of information need to be specified:

1. the address of the host
2. an identifier that specifies the receiving process in the destination host.

In the Internet, the host is identified by its **IP address**.

##### Transport Services Available to Applications

- **Reliable Data Transfer**
  - guarantee that the data sent by one end of the application is delivered correctly and completely to the other end of the application
  - Packet loss might be acceptable for **loss-tolerant** applications may
- **Throughput**
  - available throughput, which, in the context of a communication session between two processes along a network path, is the rate at which the sending
  - the application could request a guaranteed throughput
    process can deliver bits to the receiving process
  - Applications that have throughput requirements are said to be **bandwidth-sensitive** applications
  - **Elastic** applications can make use of as much, or as little, throughput as happens to be available
- **Timing**
  - A transport-layer protocol can provide timing guarantees
    > An example guarantee might be that every bit that the sender pumps into the socket arrives at the receiver’s socket no more than 100 msec later
  - For non-real-time applications, lower delay is always preferable to higher delay, but no tight constraint is placed on the end-to-end delays
- **Security**
  - A transport protocol can provide security services like confidentiality, data integrity and end-point authentication
  - For example, in the sending host, a transport protocol can encrypt all data transmitted

##### Transport Services Provided by the Internet

- **TCP**

  - **_Connection-oriented_**
    - transport-layer control information is exchanged before the application-level messages begin to flow
      > to alert the client and server, allowing them to prepare
    - After the handshaking phase, a **TCP connection** is said to exist between the sockets
    - The connection is a full-duplex connection in that the two processes can send messages to each other over the connection at the same time.
  - **_Reliable data transfer_**
    - The communicating processes can rely on TCP to deliver all data sent without error and in the proper order
  - **_Congestion-control_**
    - a service for the general welfare of the Internet rather than for the direct benefit of the communicating processes.
    - throttles a sending process (client or server) when the network is congested between sender and receiver

  > **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** : TCP-_enhanced_-with-SSL not only does everything that traditional TCP does but also provides critical process-to-process **security** services, including encryption, data integrity, and end-point authentication

- **UDP**
  > no-frills, lightweight transport protocol, providing minimal services.
  - **_connectionless_** : there is no handshaking before the two processes start to communicate.
  - **_unreliable_** data transfer service : no guarantee that the message will ever reach the receiving process. messages that do arrive at the receiving process may arrive out of order
  - does not include a congestion-control mechanism

###### Services Not Provided by Internet Transport Protocols

today’s Internet can often
provide satisfactory service to time-sensitive applications, but it cannot provide any timing or throughput guarantees

##### Application-Layer Protocols

An application-layer protocol defines how an application’s processes, running on different end systems, pass messages to each other

- The **types** of messages exchanged, for example, request messages and response messages
- The **syntax** of the various message types, such as the fields in the message and how the fields are delineated
- The **semantics** of the fields, that is, the meaning of the information in the fields
- **Rules** for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds to messages

> Some application-layer protocols are specified in RFCs and are therefore in the public domain (eg. HTTP)

An application-layer protocol is only one piece of a network application
