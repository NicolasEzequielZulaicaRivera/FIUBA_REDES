Network Layer - Control Plane 2

#### SDN

##### Reenvió basado en flujos

- openflow: identifies a flow and can set parameters over routers to facilitate the flow
- access control

##### Separación de data-plane y control-plane

- forwarding / routing

##### Control de Red: externo a los conmutadores

##### Red programable

##### Other Notes

- `TCAM`

  - Associative Memory
  - hardware device that allow ip matching (see campus)

- TP1

  - Intro to paper/rfc
  - desarrollo de un tema ( short paper: whole, long paper: part )
  - conclusion

- SDN may be local and not cover the whole AS ( it can only be as big as AS )

#### BGP

Border Gateway Protocol

##### Use & Application

- only one to operate between AS
- can also be used internally

##### Functioning

- neither link-state nor list-vector, but uses methods from both
- Functioning
  - grabs its routing table and sends it to its neighbors ( similar to rip )
  - avoids loops by using `AS_path` & discarding entries where the self AS is included
  - no flooding, signals updates on significant changes / depending on policies
- Can save multiple entries for a single destination
  - marks one entry as the one in use
  - saves more alternatives in the case its next hop disconnects to not wait for the protocol to re-run until it converges
- Can have LP ( Local Preferences ) like weights/etc, useful for local use
- traffic engineering
  - as_path prepend: adds the self ass_path many times to make the entry larger and reduce its priority (backup)
- **Anycast**: announces a single ip of a whole prefix (mask), multiple hosts have that ip

##### Policies Implementation

- transit: only announce routes of clients
- peer to peer is only announced downwards, not upwards (to providers)

##### Other Notes

- RIP & OSPF work automatically. BGP needs some configuration ( specially for providers, consumers not so much )
- **manrs** : Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security -> see ppt

#### ICPM

Internet Control Message Protocol

##### Utility

- control tool
  - react to errors
- not a must to send all ICMP messages

###### Info messages

- Echo Request -> ping -> To know if that ip is working (highly filtered nowadays)
- Echo Reply -> ping -> To know if that ip is working (highly filtered nowadays)
- Network Information -> no one responds nowadays
- Source Quench -> congestion control
- Redirect -> useful : ??

###### Error messages

- Destination Unreachable
- IPv4: Packet too Big
- IPv6: Fragment needed but DF=1
- Packet Corruption
- Time Exceded
  - during transit
  - during reassembly
- Parameter problem
