### Practice 1

<input type="date" value="2022-03-25" />

#### Exams

- 1st midterm : week 10
- retake 1 : week 12
- retake 2: w/ final

#### TPS

- groups of 3 to 5
- No out of date
- tp 1, 3 weeks , 1 or 2 people
- tp 2 & 3 , programm & demo ( everyone participates )

#### Discussion

##### What is the internet ?

- A network of networks
- Packet conmutation network ¿comunicacion?
  - Packet as informtion is packaged
  - Conmutation -> Switches

**Protocol** : set of rules & procedures

##### Layers

- **Application**
- **Transport** : Transmit messages between processes
- **Network** : Transmits information between hosts ( all routing takes place here )
- Link : `TBD`
- Physical : Moves bits

##### Performance Metrics

- **Packet Loss**

  - A node disconnects
  - Link breaks
  - Congested queue :
  - Packet Corruption (eg. is modified by interference)
  - Configuration error (eg. loop)
  - Firewall

- **Latency** : retardo entre estimulo y respuesta

  - Effects
    - UX is affected
    - Some apps are latency critical
  - Origin

    - `Insertion Time`
      - Time the pckg takes to enter a link
      - T_ins = L / R
        - L = pckg size
        - R = serialization speed
    - `Propagation Time`
      - Time the pckg takes to travel through the link
      - T_prop = d / c
        - d = distance
        - c = spd of light
    - `Processing Time`
      - Reading header & deciding which link it should be sent through
      - Is normally in the ns, despreciabl xcepto q digan lo contrario
    - `Queuing Time`
      - Time the pckg takes until its transmitted
      - Depends
        - taza de ocupacion de router
        - queue size
        - traffic
      - If more pckgs arrive than are sent => queue overflows ( packet loss )

- **RTT** : Round Trip Time
  - Time a packet takes to return to the emitter after passing through a receptor
  - It's how we estimate Latency
  - **ping**
  - Path asymmetry: when the path taken to go to the receptor is different than the return path

#### Exercise

```
Tx =  km / speed + size / BW
RTT = 2*(
  0.1 / (1.7 * 10 ^ 5) + 8000 / (10  * 10^6) +
  10  / (2   * 10 ^ 5) + 8000 / (200 * 10^6) +
  4   / (2   * 10 ^ 5) + 8000 / (200 * 10^6) +
  0.1 / (1.7 * 10 ^ 5) + 8000 / (10  * 10^6)
)
RTT = 3.5 ms
```

#### Homework

- Investigate
  - Throughput
  - Bandwidth
  - Their difference
- Install Libpcap
