#### architectures

- cli / server
- P2P
  - "very robust" as nothing is centralized ( failure point is the whole network )

#### Communication between processes

**sockets**: interface between Transport & Application layer

> embedded system :

> micro-controller = micro-processor + memory + peripherals (eg. arduino)

##### Characteristics Transport may provide

- Reliable communication
- Throughput assurance
- Synchronization
  - NTP - Network Time Protocol : Synchronizes most devices connected to the internet
- Safety (Privacy / Authentication / etc)
  > Is security of transport or application layer? kind off blurry , prof says ssl is transport book says layer
- Loss prevention
- Connected vs Disconnected

#### Normalizing Organisms

- IETF -> Internet Standards ( eg. IP, TCP & RFCs )
  - Gaia work group: make internet available to everyone
  - Impact of technology . Footprint & Energy consumption
- ITU -> Telecommunication Standards ( eg. freq ranges )
  - VoIP (voice over ip) satisfaction over delay
- W3C -> HTML Standards

#### Some Protocols

##### HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

- server-client app
- hyper text transfer ( text , images, multimedia, etc )
- Can have persistent or non-persistent connections
- web caching (middleware ?)

> HTTPS : HTTP using tcp + ssl

##### DNS (Domain Name System)

- Establishes the relation : Name <-> IP
- Database
  - hierarchical ( root -> top level domains (tld) -> ··· domains ··· -> subdomain )
    - root is many servers using n-cast
  - distributed
- Other services
  - Host aliasing ( giving an alias )
  - Mail server aliasing
    - a mail may have the same alias as a domain
    - there can be priorities so if the 1st server is down the 2nd is reached
  - Load distribution
    - multiple servers may have the same alias w/ different IPs
- Query Types
  - Authorized or not
  - Recursive or Iterative
  - Type
    - A : Name -> IP
    - NS : DNS server
    - CNAME : Name(?) -> Host canonic name ( could have many )
    - MX : Mail Exchanger
    - SOA : Start of ( a zone of ) Authority
    - PTR : Pointer to record . IP -> CNAME

#### Other notes

- Less is more
- weekly exams: concept mark
- Internet is divided in 5 zones ( formerly(?) NICs )
  - ARIN ( North America )
  - LACNIC ( Latin America & Caribbean )
  - RIPE (Europe )
  - AFRINIC ( Africa )
  - APNIC ( Asia & Pacific )
